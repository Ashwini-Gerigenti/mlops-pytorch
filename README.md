# MLOps Assignment 3 - California Housing Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using the California Housing dataset. The pipeline includes:

- Linear Regression model with scikit-learn
- Equivalent PyTorch implementation
- Docker containerization
- GitHub Actions CI/CD automation
- Manual model quantization for optimization

## Repository Structure
- `dev`: Model development using scikit-learn
- `docker_ci`: Docker + CI/CD automation
- `quantization`: Manual quantization of model weights
- `main`: Base setup and documentation

## Author
